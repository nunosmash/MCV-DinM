I'm not a programmer, but I built this with help from AI. I'm sharing this in the hopes it might be helpful to someone.

I built this to synchronize the clock between an external analog synth and a DAW. 
By default, MIDI clock is linked to Din MIDI, and most MIDI functions can be communicated via Din MIDI. Channel 16 is used for CV control.

To use CV, create a MIDI track in your DAW and set the output to channel 16. 
There are two channels : Channel 1: C1 note is the clock, C2 note is the gate. Channel 2: D1 note is the clock, D2 note is the gate.

Required components:
Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32U4)
LEDs and resistors
For DIN MIDI input: 6N138 or 6N139, 1N4148, 220, 4.7kÎ©
3.5mm female connector (CV: mono x 4, DIN: stereo x 2)

[Solder]
const int gatePin1 = 5; // Channel 1 gate pin (D1)
const int clockPin1 = 6; // Channel 1 clock pin (C1)
const int gatePin2 = 7; // Channel 2 gate pin (D2)
const int clockPin2 = 8; // Channel 2 clock pin (C2)

const int clockLedPin = 18; // Clock LED pin
const int gateLedPin = 19; // Channel 1 gate LED pin
const int gateLedPin2 = 20; // Channel 2 gate LED pin
